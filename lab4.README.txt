I created a custom png for a texture named lab4texture.png for the assignment.
I removed the lighting from my lab three for this assignment.
In doing this assignment I struggled with properly mapping the texture coordinated to the faces that I
was trying to display them on. Is there a way to shrink and grow the size of a texture in js, or is
the size of a texture permenant on load.
